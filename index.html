<h1 class="heading">About</h1>

<p>
  <strong>I am a graduate student pursuing my computer engineering at  Texas A&M University,college station.</strong> I have done my undergraduate in at Chaitanya Bharathi Institute Of Technology, Hyderabad. I am very passionate about Data Science and Deep Learning. I enjoy working with data to get impactful insights from them. My research interest focuses on <strong>Computer Vision, Deep Neural networks and few fields of Data Science.</strong> 
  <br><br>
  Presently, I am doing several projects in computer vision using OpenCV and convolutional neuran networks. I took courses like machine learning, data mining and analysis of algorithms in fall 2019 at Texas A&M University. I am enjoying the way they are shaping my interests towards this field. I am actively looking for internship opportunities for Summer 2020 in similar domains.
  <br><br>
  I solve data related problems in kaggle and learn from the community. I took up writing articles on data science and machine learning algorithms as a hobby, this way I feel I am giving back something to the society. 
  When off the path I play cricket, listen to music, watch movies, read books and understand people.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin:0px;">Machine Learning Intern <a></a>Udhyog India</a></p>
    <strong>April 2019 - July 2019</strong>
    <p>I worked in a team that was building a chatbot to the website. I had the opportunity to learn about the basic concepts of LSTMs and recommendation systems. I worked on data cleaning and applied sevral machine learning algorithms on data to understand the data and train the chatbot , built wireframes and enabled easier collection of uploaded resumes for model training and resume segregation. I also worked on deploying applications into productions and make them more intelligent by embeding machine learning. </p>
